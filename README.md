# Galaxy

Welcome to the `galaxy`, a collection of over 3000 unique UI elements from [Uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/).

Every single UI element you find in here is sourced from our main platform, [Uiverse.io](http://uiverse.io/). As designers and enthusiasts share their creations on our website, we automatically curate and upload them here for ease of access and implementation.

## Browsing the Collection

While this repository provides an archive of all the UI elements, the best way to browse is on [Uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/). There, you can search and interact with all the elements while having a visual overview.

## Contribution

Interested in growing this universe of UI components? Contribution is simple:

1. **Create & Submit**: Craft your unique UI element and submit it to [Uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/).
2. **Approval**: Once your submission is reviewed and approved on our platform, it will automatically be uploaded to this repo.

**Please note**: Direct contributions or pull requests to this repository will be ignored. The `galaxy` is exclusively managed through the [Uiverse.io](http://uiverse.io/) platform to ensure consistency and quality.

## Licensing and Attribution

All UI elements in this repository are available under the **MIT License**, granting you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute them as you please. However, while not mandatory, we deeply value and appreciate attribution.

When implementing a UI element from this collection, kindly consider giving credit to both the original creator and [Uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/). This simple act promotes the ethos of sharing, acknowledges the designer's effort, and celebrates the community spirit.
